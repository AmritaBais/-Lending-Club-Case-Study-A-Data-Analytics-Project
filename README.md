# -Lending-Club-Case-Study-A-Data-Analytics-Project
To identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA was the aim of this case study.
Business Understanding:
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, 
the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate 
 if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) 
 at a higher interest rate, etc.
